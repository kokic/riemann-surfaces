Let $f: U \to \CC$ be [holomorphic][holomorphic], with $U$ [open](./rmsf-1100.md). If $\overline D$ is any [closed disk](./rmsf-1101.md) inside $U$ and $z$ is any point in the interior $D$, then

$$
f(z) \spaces= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial D} \frac{f(w)}{w-z} \d w 
$$

if we go around the boundary once counterclockwise in performing the integration. 

This formula is something of a key to the notion of [holomorphic function][holomorphic]. For example, it explains why [holomorphic function][holomorphic] are so regular: the dependence on $z$ in the right-hand side of the equation is easy to control; e.g. we can [easily differentiate](./rmsf-1401.md), or even expand into a power series. Here are some corollaries:

Another application of the [Cauchy integral formula](./rmsf-1400.md) is the [removable singularities theorem](./rmsf-1403.md):
