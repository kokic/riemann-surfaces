[holomorphic]: ./rmsf-1200.md

If $f: U \to \CC$ is [holomorphic][holomorphic] and $D(z,r)$ is any [open disk](./rmsf-1101.md) contained in $U$, then the power series expansion for $f$ centered at $z$ converges in all of $D(z,r)$. 

Let me pause to give a cute example application of [this theorem](./rmsf-1402.md). Consider the power series

$$ F(z) \spaces= \sum_{n \ge 0} F_n \cdot z^n $$

where $F_n$ is the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number. Then the recurrence relation $F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n$ and normalization $F_0 = F_1 = 1$ translate into the relation

$$ F(z) \spaces= zF(z) + z^2F(z) + 1 $$

Using this, we find that $F(z)$ is the power series expansion of 

$$ F(z) \spaces= \frac{1}{1-z-z^2} $$

around $0$. This function $F$ is [holomorphic][holomorphic] everywhere except when $1-z-z^2=0$ i.e. when $z=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{5}}{2}$. From this we can conclude that the radius of convergence of our series $\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Indeed, $F$ is [holomorphic][holomorphic] in the disk with radius $\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$, so the above theorem tells us that the radius of convergence is at least $\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$; but on the other hand, the function $F$ tends to $\infty$ as $z$ approaches $\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$, and a power series can't tend to $\infty$ inside a region where it is defined since a power series is continuous; thus the radius of convergence is also at most $\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$, whence the claim. This tells you something about the order of growth of the $F_n$.
