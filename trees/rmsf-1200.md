$\gdef\CC{\mathbb{C}}$

Let $U \in \CC$ be an [open subset](./rmsf-0001.md), and $f: U \to \CC$ a function. We say that $f$ is holomorphic if it is complex differentiable at $z_0$ for every $z_0 \in U$, i.e. for every $z_0 \in U$ the limit (of complex numbers)

$$ \lim\limits_{z \to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0} $$

exists. (The limit value is denoted $f'(z_0)$, as usual.)
