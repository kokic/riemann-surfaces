$\gdef\CC{\mathbb{C}}$

Let $U \in \CC$ be open, and $z \in U$. Suppose $f: U \backslash \{z\} \to \CC$ is [holomorphic][holomorphic], and is bounded in some disk around $z$. Then $f$ extends uniquely is [holomorphic][holomorphic] on all of $U$. 

So merely the fact of $f$ being bounded around $z$ implies something much stronger.
