$\gdef\CC{\mathbb{C}}$
$\gdef\spaces#1{~ #1 ~}$

The set of complex numbers is 

$$ \CC \spaces= \{ a + b \cdot i \mid a, b, \in \R \} $$

For a complex number $z$ and a positive real number $r$, the _open disk_ of radius $r$ centered at $z$ is

$$ D(z,r) \spaces= \{ w \in \CC \mid |w-z| < r \} $$

and the analogous _closed disk_ is

$$ \overline D(z,r) \spaces= \{ w \in \CC \mid |w-z| \le r \} $$

Its _boundary_ is the circle

$$ \partial \overline D(z,r) \spaces= \{ w \in \CC \mid |w-z| = r \} $$
