[open-subset]: ./rmsf-1100.md

A subset $U \in \CC$ is called open if for every $z \in U$, there exists a positive real number $r$ such that $D(z,r) \subset U$. 

It is equivalent to ask that $U$ be a union of [open disks](./rmsf-1101.md). 

The reason we want to consider [open subsets][open-subset] is that we want to differentiate. To differentiate, you need to know not just the values of your function at a point, but its value at all points sufficiently close to your point. An [open subset][open-subset] is exactly a subset which, if it contains a point, contains all sufficiently close points as well.
