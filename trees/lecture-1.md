The subject of this course is Riemann surfaces. A one sentence "definition" of a Riemann surface is that is geometric object obtained by patching together pieces of the complex plane along _biholomorphic maps_. Before studying Riemann surfaces, it's a good idea to understand the notion of a biholomorphic map, or more generally, just a [holomorphic][holomorphic]. In this lecture we'll review the basic definitions and results on [holomorphic maps][holomorphic], giving some intuitive explanations but no proofs. For the proofs you can see any basic text on complex analysis.

Here is the first definition.

Now we can say what is a [holomorphic function][holomorphic].
