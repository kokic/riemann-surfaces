Now we have reviewed the basis of [holomorphic][holomorphic] functions. But there's one important question we should still discuss: where do [holomorphic functions][holomorphic] come from? Why do they exist?

The answer is that they come from a variety of sources. We'll talk about two of the more important ones in the next lecture: they come from solution of polynomial (or more generally [holomorphic][holomorphic]) equations, and also from solutions of holomorphic differential equations. 

But for now we'll give a different kind of answer, First of all, the identity function $z: \CC \to \CC$ is [holomorphic][holomorphic], as is any constant function. Second, the class of [holomorphic functions][holomorphic] is closed under addition and multiplication. Thus, every polynomial is [holomorphic][holomorphic]. (The proof of these claims is formally just like the real variable case.) Then, we can access more [holomorphic functions][holomorphic] by talking limits of polynomials, thanks to the following theorem (also a consequence of [Cauchy formula](./rmsf-1400.md)!):
