Let $f: U \to \CC$ be a [holomorphic function](./rmsf-0002.md) on an [open subset](./rmsf-0001.md) of $\CC$ of, and let $\overline D(z, r)$ be closed disc contained in $U$. Then the average value of $f$ on the boundary $\partial \overline D(z,r)$ is equal to the value of $f$ at the center, i.e.

$$ f(z) \spaces= \frac{1}{2\pi r}\int_{\partial \overline D(z,r)} f(w) \cdot |\d w| $$

Here we should be imagining $w$ tracing around the circle $\partial \overline D(z,r)$, and $\d w$ as picking up the infinitesimal arc length. The $2\pi r$ corresponds to length of the circle, i.e. $\int_{\partial \overline D(z,r)} |\d w|$.
